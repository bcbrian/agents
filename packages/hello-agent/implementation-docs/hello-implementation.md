# Hello Agent Implementation

This document outlines the implementation details for a minimal "Hello World" agent that follows the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Overview

The Hello Agent is a simple template designed to showcase the basic structure needed for an MCP-compliant agent. It responds to queries containing "hello world" with a markdown-formatted heading.

## Architecture

The agent follows the Model Context Protocol, which defines a standard way for AI models to interact with external tools and services. The implementation consists of:

1. **MCP Server**: Handles protocol communication using the MCP SDK
2. **Tool Handler**: Processes incoming tool call requests
3. **Response Generator**: Creates the markdown response

## Components

### MCP Server

The server is implemented using the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` library, which provides:
- JSON-RPC communication handling
- Protocol message validation
- Standard request/response patterns

### Hello World Tool

The agent exposes a single tool called `sayHello` which:
- Takes no arguments or simple text input
- Returns a markdown-formatted "# hello world" heading
- Provides schema validation for inputs and outputs

## Protocol Implementation

### Tool Registration

The agent registers its tool with the MCP server, providing:
- Name and description
- Input/output schemas
- Handler function

### Request Handling

When a client sends a tool call request:
1. The server validates the request against the tool's schema
2. The request is routed to the appropriate handler
3. The handler generates a markdown response
4. The response is returned to the client

## Implementation Notes

- The agent uses Node.js and TypeScript
- Input/output is handled via stdin/stdout (stdio transport)
- Error handling follows MCP protocol guidelines

## Comparison to Browser Driver

This agent is a simplified version inspired by the Browser Driver agent. While the Browser Driver provides complex browser automation functionality, this Hello Agent focuses on:

1. **Minimal Dependencies**: Just the MCP SDK
2. **Simple Response**: Single markdown output
3. **Template Structure**: Easy to extend for more complex features

## Development Plan

1. **Core Implementation**: Basic MCP server with hello world tool
2. **Testing**: Simple test cases to verify functionality 
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive usage guide
4. **Future Extensions**: Potentially add more basic response tools

## Reference

This implementation uses the browser-driver agent as a reference. For a more complex implementation of an MCP agent, refer to that codebase.
